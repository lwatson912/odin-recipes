<h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>

<p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>

    <li>Lasagna sheets</li>
    <li>Beef mince</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    <li>White sauce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
</ol>
